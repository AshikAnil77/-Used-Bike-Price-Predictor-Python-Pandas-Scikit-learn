Here is the updated README.md based on your plan to ignore the .pkl files.

🛵 Used Bike Price Predictor
A machine learning project that predicts the resale value of used bikes using a RandomForestRegressor model and deploys it as an interactive web app with Streamlit.

📖 About This Project
This project takes a dataset of used bike listings and builds a machine learning model to estimate a bike's resale price. The goal is to create a simple, user-friendly web app where a user can input a bike's features and get an instant price prediction.

The model's preprocessing pipeline involves:

One-Hot Encoding for categorical features (like brand, city, etc.).

Standard Scaling for numerical features (like kms driven, age, etc.).

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python

Jupyter Notebook: For model training and experimentation.

Scikit-learn: For the RandomForestRegressor, OneHotEncoder, and StandardScaler.

Pandas: For data loading and manipulation.

Streamlit: For creating the interactive web application.

Joblib: For saving and loading the trained models.

🚀 How to Run
This project shares the code and data, but not the pre-trained model files (as they are too large for GitHub). You must run the training notebook first to generate the models.

1. Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
2. Create a virtual environment & install requirements:

Bash

python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
(Note: Make sure you have a requirements.txt file in your repository.)

3. 💥 Run the Training Notebook (IMPORTANT):

Open your Jupyter Notebook (e.g., training_notebook.ipynb).

Run all the cells from top to bottom.

This will execute the training process and create the necessary files: bike_price_model.pkl, encoder.pkl, and scaler.pkl.

4. Run the Streamlit App:

Now that the .pkl files exist, you can start the app.

Bash

streamlit run app.py
5. Open your browser!

Your browser should automatically open to http://localhost:8501.
